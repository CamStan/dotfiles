* CamStan's homedir settings files
  These files are organized by type. Using the =synch.sh= script, local changes can be pulled. 
  Private info is stored in the =~/.extra= file on each local machine. Source'd by bash.

** Setup
   All config files are located in ~/.config/ directory and are grouped into sub-directories by type. 
   From here, all dot file expected in different locations by the operating system are sym-linked.
   These are listed in the =links= file of each directory.

*** Dot file symlinks
    - ~/.bash_profile
    - ~/.bashrc
    - ~/.inputrc
    - ~/.vimrc

** Installation
   Get the git repo, then update homedir
   : git clone git@github.com:camstan/dotfiles.git
   : cd dotfiles
   : ./synch.sh
